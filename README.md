# fabric-os
A 32-Bit Operating System written in **URCL**

## Features ##
- Multiprocessing
- Graphic / Audio Ports
- Custom FS
- Basic IL with Libraries
- Installer

## Run fabricOS ##
To run fabricOS you can either compile the source file to an instruction set, which is supported by your CPU or you can use an emulator for URCL like URCL Explorer by BramOtte (https://bramotte.github.io/urcl-explorer) to directly run the OS in your web browser. FabricOS requires a storage file which can be downloaded from this repository. Alternatively, you can insert an empty file (containing only 0s) with a recommended size of ~1KB and let the installer create a basic installation of fabricOS. The amount of storage available is determined by the size of your storage file.
